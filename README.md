<h1 Align="Center"> Mapping Earthquakes </h1>

<p> in this assignment we used Mapbox, Leafletjs, and GeoJSONs to create a webpage that displays earthquakes and tectonic plates. This map can be toggled between street, satellite, and dark modes and can be set to display any/all of earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes (ones above 5 magnitude)</p>

<p> example 1: Dark map with all earthquakes and tectonic plates, colored by intensity in 6 steps</p>
